         <h3>124 + 625 Roman Columns  is a sarcastic, poetic multimedia archive of “Chinese roman columns”.

 The Greeks developed the classical orders of architecture, which are most easily distinguished by the form of the column. Columns are largely use in modern architectures. Apart from its practical functions, this architectural element promotes a rich, ideal and noble style. Because of this connotation that it carries, people in China like to use roman columns in a lot of situations: from a permanent construction in a fancy real estate, to a temporary decoration in a wedding, and to a newly built house in countryside…
 Because of a large amount of needs, Chinese producers have always been busy with roman columns. There are numerous different kinds of roman columns being sold on taobao.com — columns made of plasters, plastic, concrete, rubber and column’s moulds…

 This work is an interactive archive of Chinese roman columns. I collected 124 roman columns in Beijing, by capturing them with my camera, and 625 roman columns’ images from taobao.com, by scraping the data from the web shops and integrating them into a self-growing system.

 The installation consists the the film “124 Roman Columns”, the interactive website of 625 roman columns and the printed version of the 625 columns. The film has 3 chapters: ORDER, IDEALISM and VICTORY, which respectively show the columns, sculptures and triumphal scenes in the architectures in Beijing.
