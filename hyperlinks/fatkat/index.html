          <p3>There is a hair salon called Fat Kat in China town opened by Chinese. Its name in Chinese is 髮嘉 (“faat gaa”) which means hair-pretty, a total different meaning with similar pronunciation. The combination of these two names creates not only a linguistic easiness but also a humorous contradiction content-wise. It shows how three different languages — English, Dutch and Chinese are decoded and blended into one. However, If we look closely to the graphic design, we see the 髮 (hair), is designed in a very figurative way referring wavy and curly hair using the fragments and strokes. Being such pictorial with your letter design is no doubt not very welcomed in academia in modern art and design context. But before we judge it — are we able to study it within the european framework for letter design, if it deals with a total different writing system? Is there another solitary and complete framework for it, and how separated should it be from the one we are being learnt?
<br /><br />
Studying graphic design in a dutch art school, we learn the history of graphic design from the western point of view. It is a linear, progressive, evolutive and monocular narrative about modernism. When it comes to regions outside of Europe, the history of THEIR, defined-by-Europe and influenced-by-Europe graphic design, is always a solitary chapter in the textbook, is always behind, exotic, and out-of-the-system. How do we look at the non-european graphic design? Where and how do they exist, in the city centre of a north european country, one of the birthplaces of modernism?
<br /><br />
Having this in mind, I started to document the graphic design going on in China town in the Hague, a self-alienated cultural compact of all outsiders — China, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand, Turkey, Surinam, Morocco, Colombia… This is a visual archive of the images, representing the local visual communication created by some of these minority groups. It contains visual design around/for food, beauty, leisure, display design and package design.
<br /><br />
Coming from China and studying graphic design in a dutch art school, the way I look at China town graphic design is, inevitably, an euro-centric and orientalist gaze — It is an awkward encounter and a puzzling relationship of my origin and my academic knowledge. I look at their graphic design and evaluate its quality with the knowledge the school learnt me on typographical legibility based on english language and photographical strategies that please a cornered market. In this way of looking at it, it is, and only can be, amateur, literal, pictorial and naive. Sometimes it is also strategically nostalgic, in order to refer to their history; some of it glamorises the exoticism to express their authenticity.
<br /><br />
What now?
<br /><br />
I judged, I gazed. I am not innocent. But I embrace it, and I dare to do so. Meanwhile I am self aware and I would like to question, if there is an exit from an euro-centric art academia, and a better re-entry to the non-european, with a more inclusive view point on cultural and linguistic aspects. I also wonder, if we are able to unlearn. Knowledge can only be a mask, a prison, and an island, if we don't unseal its closure and repel the authority. By the same time of unlearning, we let the unknown and misjudged learn us.
<br /><br />
髮嘉, a word, a sign, a complication. It is decoded, and now being encoded again. But instead of solving it from above, it’s time for it to unfold itself for us.
