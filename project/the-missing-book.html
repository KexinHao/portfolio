          What is reading? What are you reading? What is the difference of text and blankness and what do
          they tell you?<br /><br />
          This is what I want to question the reader, by my book design. The sentences that tell the story are
          crossed — is a story necessary? Space is constructed in text — how does time pass and what had
          happened in-between? Are you reading the blankness?<br /><br />
          Instead of presenting the book for reader, I allow the public to go to the bookcase and dig for the
          “real” book among 16 empty books. I intend to let them questioned, also with the interaction and
          effort they pay.<br /><br />
          The novel, in the style of stream of consciousness doesn’t narrate either a great story, or construct
          a deep thought. It only depicts and simulates the feelings that pass through the mind. I always like
          to read this kind of literature to get lost, and to forget my expectation from the reading. This time, I
          want people not only to read and get the things they “want” from reading, but also focus and think
          about the activity of reading itself.
