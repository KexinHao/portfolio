        <p>"Yes sir, I can boogie." — a 80s hit disco song by a Spanish female duo Baccara got viral in Europe back in the days. While showing a woman's perspective in the song, the single is written by Frank Dostal and Rolf Soja, and produced by Soja — who are all MEN. Before the production of the song and the fame, the duo were spotted by Leon Deane, the record company's manager — who is also MAN. And in those video clips of live performance, you will see that MEN are the major audience and the ones that enjoy the song.
        <br /><br />
        This illustrates the female role in the music(and a lot more) industry — being qualified, designed and sold — as a doll in a package. And the money goes to men. Two ladies were dressed up, twisting their bodies stiffly on the stage — you wonder if they enjoyed themselves, maybe it's a yes. But who ever cared? Who ever asked them?
        <br /><br />
        I re-performed this song and would like to show the women's reversed role: being the initiative, and the agency itself: being able to design the stage and choose my audience. Being sexy, because I want to, not from someone else's force. Being loud: Yes sir, I can boogie. Because I want to say so, not because you ever want to hear that.
