          Have you ever wondered about the school renovation? What is taking place and why? Who are working on it and what are the tasks?<br /><br />
          As one production from the "SCHOOL" project, I got to interview people who work for the renovation of KABK and made a short video for a better knowing.<br /><br />
          At KABK we like to think within the art school curriculum. But school is also so much about the building itself, the physical surroundings, and people who are working FOR the school in any supportive branches.
