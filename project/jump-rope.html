         How do you write? How do people define the action of writing? Does it always invole hand, pen and paper?
         <br /><br />
         Looking for alternative ways of "writing" and reconstructing the meaning of writing, I use body movement in a certain game to achieve it.
         <br /><br />
         “An in-between place provides the common ground where conflicting polarities can again become twin phenomena.” Inspired by Aldo van Eyck’s point of view on architecture, I want to express the sentence in a spacious and dynamic typographical way.
         <br /><br />
         I had lots of joy from the jumping rope game when I was a kid. I think this game is a great system showing two polarities being reconciled: you are in and out, and in again.
         <br /><br />
         I shaped the letters by jumping rope in a route of the how you write the letters. In this way, I let the “in-out” polarities meet, and the “writing” itself re-judicated.
