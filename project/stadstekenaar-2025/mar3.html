           I found this lithograph print at the Haagse Gemeentearchief. It is a vintage illustration commemorating the 10th Dutch Language and Literature Congress (X. Nederlandsch Taal en Letterkundig Congres), which took place in 1868 in The Hague. The artwork is very allegorical, incorporating mythological and classical elements.
           <br /><br />
           A sea nymph, riding in a shell chariot drawn by two sea horses, carries a net filled with the menu from the banquet held on September 1, 1868, during the 10th Dutch Language and Literature Congress at the bathhouse. The names of the dishes are accompanied by literary quotations.
           <br /><br />
           In the sky, Minerva (goddess of wisdom) and Euterpe (muse of music and lyric poetry) float above the scene.
           <br /><br />
           The background features the Scheveningen coast. To the left, the bathhouse and several hotels, including the Pavilion of Wied, can be seen, while on the right, the village of Scheveningen is visible.

           What makes this print so fascinating is its unique combination of illustration and menu card. The illustration features allegorical and imagined figures, while the menu lists the actual food served that day, accompanied by poetic and humorous interpretations of the dishes. This makes the piece not just a work of visual and literary art, but also a functional object.
           <br /><br />
           It also reflects how people in 1868 viewed animals and nature—as food, resources, or things to conquer and control. The perspective is unmistakably human-centered.
           <br /><br />
           In my drawing, “Op Onze Coalitie,” I want to borrow this format—blending illustration with a menu card—but from a modern perspective. In my version, humans are not gods, and animals are not mounts. None of us is mythical, magical, or holy. We coexist.
