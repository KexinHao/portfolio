               Spill Your Guts is a performative card game developed for the networking event of Proximity Music. It was designed to encourage interaction among creative professionals through a playful system of card exchange.
               <br /><br />
               <p id="italic-in-block">Gameplay Mechanics:</p>
               Each participant starts with 7 identical gut microbe cards, representing a uniform microbiome. When two participants interact, they exchange one card each. With each swap, their microbiomes become more diverse.
               <br /><br />
               The goal is to collect 7 different cards. Once achieved, the participant can claim a special drink at the bar—a symbolic “detox” marking the completion of the exchange cycle.
               <br /><br />
               Before trading, participants are prompted to “spill their guts” by sharing something personal, professional, or simply conversational. This verbal exchange is considered part of the card-trading ritual.
               <br /><br />
               <p id="italic-in-block">The Drink:</p>
               The drink awarded at the bar is non-alcoholic and made with tapioca pearls, pandan leaves, and butterfly pea flowers. It features a thick texture and layered colours, creating a visual and sensory contrast that is both unusual and appealing—simultaneously repelling and attractive.
