               I have been hunting for second hand soft porn comics from thrift stores and flea markets here for a while.
               Tons of them all tell about a heterosexual and heteronormative story, heavily stereotyping and objectifying women and races.
               Quite many among them depict women of colour, to highlight the imperial and colonial masculinity in a white perspective.
               <br /><br />
               <!-- I get embarrassed, overwhelmed, but also often times *secretly* fascinated by them. It felt like: I know all the stories going on here,
               but I would like to read them one by one, to confirm the “same old shit”.  -->
               They keep reminding me that, even though we are witnessing a change in narrative in film/comic/entertainment industry,
               the male and colonial hegemony is still everywhere, has been mass produced and been surrounding us in an innocent, uncensored format.
               <br /><br />
               While my collection is still growing, I decided to present some of them in a publication, along with four crucial texts on male gaze and colonial gaze.
