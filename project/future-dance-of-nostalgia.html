        <h3>Future Dance of Nostalgia</h3>

          The dance movements in this game originate from extinct human activities that involves a lot of repetitive body movements, such as growing crops and manual weaving.
          <br /><br />I would like to look at these disappearing activities that are soon to be totally replaced by technologies and robots, with a retro-futuristic perspective, as well as a non-linear timeline: to jump to the future to look at the past. I would like to imagine a future where people feel nostalgic for the ancient manner of labor, and they invent dance movements that mimic the manner, yet totally detach the meaning from it.
          <br /><br />Through an entertaining approach, this dance aims to help the preservation of ancient human knowledge that are embedded in the historical body and woven into our physical body memory.
          <br /><br />
